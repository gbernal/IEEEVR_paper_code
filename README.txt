The files shared here are intended to be used with Google Colab to help reduce the setup time. 
Please place the folder SharedPublicly into your google drive of your choice.
After that is done, you can open any of the .ipynb files using google colab. 
Each file has cells that need to be run sequentially.
Before running the cell, you will need to adjust the data path.
